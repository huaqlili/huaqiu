# 🧑 About me

I am currently a 2nd-year Master's student at [Tsinghua Shenzhen International Graduate School (SIGS)](https://www.sigs.tsinghua.edu.cn/), majoring in Electronic Information (Artificial Intelligence) under the supervision of [Prof. Haoqian Wang](https://www.sigs.tsinghua.edu.cn/whq/). In Fall 2023, I earned my Bachelor of Engineering in Aircraft Control and Information Engineering from Beihang University.

My work primarily centers on:  

- Controllable Multimodal Generation  
  ▪ Text-to-image/video Synthesis with Fine-grained Control  
- Low-Level Vision  
  ▪ Image Restoration (denoising, super-resolution, enhancement)  
  ▪ Computational Imaging (novel reconstruction paradigms)  
- Self-Supervised & Unsupervised Learning  
  ▪ Representation learning from unlabeled visual data  

For future research, I am particularly interested in topics as follows:

▪ Trustworthy Media Generation  
▪ Visual Editing & Super-Resolution  
▪ Visual Generation for Embodied AI  

**I am looking for a Ph.D. position (26 Fall) in Generative AI and Image/video reconstruction/generation**, feel free to contact me at lihuaqiu2025@gmail.com or lihq23@mails.tsinghua.edu.cn.
